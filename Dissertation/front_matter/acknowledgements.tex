\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}  % Needs to be set to part, so the TOC doesnt add 'CHAPTER ' prefix in the TOC.


\indent I am thankful for the years of teaching and guidance provided by my co-chairs Dr. Jean Ragusa and Dr. Jim Morel; you convinced me long ago that a career in research was worth the extra challenges, costs, and years of work.  I would also like to thank Dr. Marvin Adams for initially guiding me to the Computational Methods Group at Texas A\&M and for encouraging me to consider Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for post-graduation employment.  
Additionally, I thank I would like to thank Dr. Jean-Luc Guermond for your time and feedback on this dissertation and the master's thesis that preceeded it.
Finally, I wish to thank the Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (administered by the Krell institute under grant number DE-FG02-97ER25308) for financial support during this work.
