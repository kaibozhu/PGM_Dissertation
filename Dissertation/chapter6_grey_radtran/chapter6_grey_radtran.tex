\chapter{\uppercase{Grey Thermal Radiative Transfer}}
\label{sec:chapter6_grey_radtran}

We now apply our self-lumping DFEM methodology to the grey thermal radiative transfer equations.
Our framework will be very similar to that presented by Morel et al in \cite{morel_radtran}.
That is, we will linearize the Planckian about an arbitrary temperature and expand the spatial dependence of the Planckian in a $P$ degree trial space.
We will also expand the angular intensity, $I$, and temperature, $T$ in a $P$ degree trial space as well.
